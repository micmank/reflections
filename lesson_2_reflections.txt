Why do you need to do it? It creates the necessary GIT files that will be used for later commits, branches, etc.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? It is the area where you're ready to commit a file and is ready for being tracked.  Files in the working directory are not being tracked and ready for commits.
