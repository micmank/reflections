When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? When you're working with a team and
using the same repository or if someone else needs to add files to your work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  Because each pull requires bandwidth and it's better to manually pull if you're doing a number of changes on the remote.
